# Golang Gin API with OpenAPI v3 Docs

This demonstrates a simple way to document an API built in Go with the [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework. The OpenAPI definition is generated by [swaggo/swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag/tree/v2) using annotations directly in your code.

Here I'm taking a "code-first" approach as opposed to the "contract-first" API development favored by popular API code generators like [oapi-codegen](https://github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/) and [ogen](https://github.com/ogen-go/ogen). I agree with commenters on [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1gmhz08/confused_by_the_openapi_options_for_go/) who lament the complexity of these code generators and the general landscape of Go API documentation tools. My use case is that I already have an API that I need to document, so it's a waste of time to dump everything and go "contract-first". Plus I prefer the greater flexibility. I'm not a Go wizard so the code generated by oapi-codegen looks unnecessarily complex to me.

I pulled the majority of this demo from here: https://blog.logrocket.com/documenting-go-web-apis-with-swag/

Note [swag's](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) homepage states that it only supports OpenAPI v2. Not exactly true. Their v2.0.0-rc4 release supports OpenAPI v3.1. Hopefully they promote that to an official release soon, but for now it seems to work okay.

## Usage

Generate the OpenAPI v3.1 definition:
```
swag init --v3.1
```

Run the API. The docs are served at http://localhost:8080/
```
go run main.go
```
